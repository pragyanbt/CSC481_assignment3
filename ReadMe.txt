#Getting Started
The `TicketSale` contract is written in Solidity (version 0.8.17) and uses [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/) and [Web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/) for local Ethereum network simulation and interaction. To interact with the contract, youâ€™ll need to deploy it to a test Ethereum network and execute transactions through a Web3-compatible platform like [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) or with Node.js scripts.

#Features
- **Ticket Purchasing**: Users can buy tickets by sending the required amount of Ether to the contract.
- **Swaps**: Users can offer swaps with other ticket holders and accept offers to exchange tickets with others.
- **Resales**: Users can resell their tickets by setting a resale price, allowing other users to buy these tickets.
- **Manager Control**: The contract deployer has special privileges to oversee specific actions.

#Contract Structure
The contract consists of:
- Manager: The contract deployer who can oversee ticket sales.
- Mappings: Track ticket ownership (`ticketOwners`), tickets owned by each address (`ticketsOwnedBy`), ticket resale prices (`resalePrices`), and swap offers (`swapOffers`).
- Core Functions:
  - `buyTicket`: Allows users to purchase available tickets.
  - `offerSwap`: Allows ticket owners to offer their ticket for swapping.
  - `acceptSwap`: Lets a user accept a ticket swap offer from another user.
  - `resaleTicket`: Sets a resale price for a ticket owned by the caller.
  - `acceptResale`: Allows a user to buy a resale ticket by paying the resale price.
